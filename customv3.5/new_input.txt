The following Linux command allows users to view the last 10 lines of a file: `tail file.txt`.

If you want to view only the last 5 lines of a file, you can use the following Linux command: `tail -n 5 file.txt`.

The Linux command `tail` is used to display the last lines of a file by default. For instance, running `tail file.txt` would display the last 10 lines of the file.

Another way to view the last lines of a file is by using the `tail` command along with the `-f` parameter. This will keep the file open and display any new lines that are added in real-time: `tail -f file.txt`.

In addition to displaying the last lines of a file, the `tail` command can also be used to continuously monitor a file for changes. To accomplish this, simply use `tail -f file.txt` and any new lines that are added to the file will be displayed in real-time.

copies /mnt/data/ to /mnt/backup/ preserving attributes and doesn't copy if exists
The 'cp' command can be used to copy files or directories from one location to another. In this case, you can use the option '-a' to preserve the attributes of the source directory and the option '-n' to not copy if the file already exists at the destination location. The command would be: 'cp -an /mnt/data/ /mnt/backup/'

A reliable way to transfer data from one directory location to another is to use the Linux 'cp' command. When used with the '-a' option, the original attributes of the file or directory are retained. To prevent overwriting an existing file or directory, you can use the '-n' option. For example: 'cp -an /mnt/data/ /mnt/backup/'

For copying data from one directory to another, the 'cp' command is a widely used tool in Linux. You can specify the source directory followed by the target directory. With the '-a' option, you can preserve the attributes of the files and directories during the transfer. If a file already exists in the destination directory, the transfer can be skipped using the '-n' option. Use: 'cp -an /mnt/data/ /mnt/backup/'

Maintaining file attributes while transferring data from one directory to another is important, and the command line tool 'cp' can help with that. By running 'cp -a', you can preserve the attributes of the source directory, and with '-n', you can avoid copying files that already exist at the destination directory. To use this command for the described scenario, type: 'cp -an /mnt/data/ /mnt/backup/'

In Linux, you can use the command 'cp' to copy one or more files/directories from one location to another. The '-a' option can be used to copy the source location's attributes to the target location. Additionally, the '-n' option can be used to skip copying files that already exist at the target location. To copy the '/mnt/data/' directory to '/mnt/backup/' while retaining attributes and skipping existing files, run: 'cp -an /mnt/data/ /mnt/backup/'
